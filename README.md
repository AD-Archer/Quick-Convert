# Quick Convert

A collection of fast, free, and private image conversion tools that run entirely in your browser.

## About

Originally created by [Theo](https://github.com/t3dotgg) because he wanted a better way to upscale SVGs as PNGs. I built this version because I thought it was cool and HEIC files annoy me.

## Features

- **SVG to PNG Converter**: Theo's original. Still the simplest SVG converter around.
- **WebP Converter**: Because nobody asked for WebP, but here we are.
- **HEIC to PNG**: For when your iPhone photos won't play nice with anything.
